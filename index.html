          <h3>Background of the project</h3>
          <p class="lead"><b>Timetable</b> is an application which aims to bring different timetables from all triposes, departments and faculties at the University of Cambridge together into one central place.</p>

          <p>Many of you might remember the printed Reporter which contained a printed version of all timetables, and the Lecture Listings that replaced it. Timetable aims to be the next step forward in the process of making all timetables in the University available online and easily editable for administrators before and during the academic year. Students will greatly benefit from being able to create their own personal calendar with events from their own or another department.</p>

            <h3>Where we want to get to</h3>

            <p><b>Timetable</b> is currently in beta release following comprehensive feedback sessions. It will offer valuable functionality to administrators and students for the academic year 2013-14 and beyond. It will be available for administrators after the exam period and only available to students in mid-September, which means administrators will have time to familiarise themselves with it, and to update data as necessary. We are very happy for you to get in contact with us if you need assistance with any of this. Over the next few weeks we will add functionality to the beta release to provide you with an improved timetable experience.<p>

          <p>Once data has been added by administrative staff, students will be able to look for the subject and part they're studying </p><p>and will see the different modules that belong to this timetable. They will also see 'series' (or papers) belonging to these modules. In order to build their own personal timetable, they can then choose to 'add' or 'remove' these to the calendar visible on the right of the screen. Events (lectures, practicals, etc.,) can also be added. </p>

        <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:asd38@caret.cam.ac.uk">Anne-Sophie De Baets</a> with your CRSid and she will add you as an admin user. Once logged in, you will be taken to the first Tripos or Department that you have edit rights to. You will still be able to view other timetables too. You can find Triposes and Departments by using the dropdown. Each timetable in a Department or Tripos is presented as a tile. The ones you have permission to edit are indicated with a pencil icon and the text 'Edit', while the ones you can’t are shown as 'View only'. </p>

        <p>List view displays the entire list of modules (or papers), lecture series and events (such as lectures, classes, talks, seminars, and so on) associated with it. Each event shows the 'title of the event', lecturer/host, etc. Changes can be made by clicking the pencil icon and typing in the selected field. You can also change the title of a series or module by clicking on the pencil icon next to the title. Events can be cancelled here if, for example, a lecturer is off sick and there is no replacement. After making your changes, click the 'Save' button to make the changes visible to students and other administrators. </p>

        <h3>Create a new event, series (paper) or module</h3>
        <img src="images/gallery/4.png" alt="Create Event"/>

        <p>Imagine there is a seminar that has to be repeated but isn't in the timetable yet. In that case, once you've located which series it belongs to, you can click the 'add event' option below the series. This will duplicate the last event so make sure you edit the information that has be edited (eg give it a different title). Once saved, this event will display chronologically. In the somewhat less likely event that you want to create a new series, you can find the 'new series' button right below the module title. Make sure to change the title otherwise it won't be saved. If you have to create a new module, just follow the same procedure as for creating a new series. Once the academic year starts, students will be able to find these new events, series and modules. The option to add a new timetable isn't available yet, but is planned for future release.</p>

        <h3>Removing a series or module, and cancelling an event</h3>
        <img src="images/gallery/5.png" alt=""/>

        <p>You may need to cancel an event if for example, a lecturer is off sick and there is no replacement. You do this by clicking on the bin icon next to the specific event, which will strike through the event. You can cancel or edit various events simultaneously – just click 'Save' to save your changes. If you want to remove a module or series (eg because you have entered them incorrectly), you can click on the bin icon next to the series or module title. This will permanently remove these from the system – please note that removing a series or module can't be undone!</p>

        <p>Once you have created a timetable, you will see the list view. If you want to see the week view for a specific timetable, click on the 'calendar' tab at the top of the timetable page. This will show the events for this timetable only. If you wish to see different timetables together in a calendar, you can’t yet do this from the admin interface - you would have to look at the student interface for now and add these to a personal calendar. The option to see this in the admin interface is planned for future release. </p>

          <h3>Timetable will continue to improve</h3>
          <img src="images/gallery/7.png" alt=""/>

          <p>Future releases will offer a more attractive visual style and fuller functionality to make updating of timetables an easier task. Planned feature include: 'duplicating of events, series, and modules'; 'being able to send out notifications when changes are made’, ‘being able to embed the timetable on a departmental website'; and many more. We are also aware of the fact that some events or series may not be in the system yet, or seem to be incorrect. We've done a lot of work already entering all of this data, but we would hugely value any feedback and involvement from administrators...that's you! Let us know, and we’ll do our very best to incorporate your feedback. </p>
